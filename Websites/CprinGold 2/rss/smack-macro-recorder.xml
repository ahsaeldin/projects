    <title>Smack macro recorder</title>
    <description>Smack can record keystrokes, mouse clicks and movements 
and playback under three types of speed (High-Normal-Low). 
with Normal speed keystrokes and mouse clicks are played 
back as they recorded exactly.with high speed keystrokes, 
mouse movements and clicks are played back with no 
delaying time between your event.with low speed keystrokes, 
mouse movements and clicks are played back with delaying 
time between your event but more than the normal.  Smack 
can also generate an Executable Macro file , it means that 
you can choose any macro you had saved before and simply 
click &quot;stand alone &quot; command button to generate an 
Executable file for the macro with *.exe extension so it can 
be run without Smack , just need the vb runtime installed.</description>
